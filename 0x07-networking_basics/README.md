##Networking Basics Project

##Introduction

Welcome to the Networking Basics project! This project aims to enhance your understanding of computer networking concepts and protocols. 
You will learn about the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and more. 
Additionally, you will write Bash scripts to implement specific tasks related to networking.

##Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

OSI Model: Understanding its purpose, organization, and layers.
LAN and WAN: Differentiating between local and wide area networks.
Internet: Understanding its role in network communication.
MAC and IP Addresses: Identifying unique network identifiers.
TCP and UDP: Understanding the differences and use cases.
TCP/UDP Ports: Identifying commonly used port numbers.
ICMP and Ping: Understanding network device availability checks.

##Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on specific networking concepts. The tasks are as follows:

OSI model: Answer questions related to the OSI model's purpose and organization.
Types of network: Identify the type of network based on scenarios provided.
MAC and IP address: Describe MAC and IP addresses and their roles in networking.
TCP and UDP: Differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols.
TCP and UDP ports: Create a Bash script to display listening ports with program names.
Is the host on the network: Implement a Bash script to ping an IP address and check for availability.
Requirements
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Text Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Bash Scripting: All Bash script files must be executable and pass shellcheck without errors.
Language: All code and documentation should be written in English (UK) language.

##Usage
Each task in the project will have its dedicated script file, identified by the task number. 
To execute a specific task, run the corresponding script from the terminal. For example:

$ ./0-OSI_model
