##Networking Basics 2

##Introduction

Welcome to the Networking Basics 2 project! This project is a continuation of the previous Networking Basics project and aims 
to further enhance your understanding of computer networking concepts and protocols. You will explore topics such as localhost, 
0.0.0.0, the hosts file, and netcat examples. Additionally, you will write Bash scripts to implement specific networking tasks.

##Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

General:
What is localhost/127.0.0.1
What is 0.0.0.0
What is /etc/hosts
How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces

##Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on specific networking concepts. The tasks are as follows:

Change your home IP: Write a Bash script to configure an Ubuntu server with specific requirements for resolving localhost and facebook.com.
Show attached IPs: Write a Bash script to display all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it's executed on.

##Requirements

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Text Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Bash Scripting: All Bash script files must be executable and pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0 via apt-get) without any errors.
Language: All code and documentation should be written in English (UK) language.
Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the GitHub repository alx-system_engineering-devops and navigate to the 0x08-networking_basics_2 directory.

##Usage

Each task in the project will have its dedicated script file, identified by the task number. 
To execute a specific task, run the corresponding script from the terminal. For example:

$ ./0-change_your_home_IP
