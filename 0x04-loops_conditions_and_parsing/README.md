About Bash Projects

Welcome to the Bash projects! In this directory, you will find a collection of Bash scripts focusing on loops, conditions, and parsing. 
These projects aim to strengthen your understanding of essential concepts in Bash scripting and prepare you for managing servers and 
automating tasks effectively.

Background Context

The projects in this repository cover various aspects of Bash scripting, including loops (for, while, until), conditionals (if, else, elif, case), 
file parsing, and the use of comparison operators. Additionally, you'll learn about the importance of creating SSH keys for secure remote access 
to servers.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, i have  achieved the following learning objectives:

Creating SSH keys: Understand how to generate an RSA key pair and the significance of using public and private keys for secure authentication.

Looping with for, while, and until: Master the usage of for, while, and until loops for performing repetitive tasks in Bash scripts.

Conditionals: Learn how to use if, else, elif, and case statements to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

Cut command and file test operators: Familiarize yourself with the cut command and file test operators for efficient text manipulation 
and file operations.

Creating portable scripts: Write Bash scripts that are compatible with different environments to ensure maximum portability.

Requirements

Before you proceed with viewing  the projects, please take note of the following requirements:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Each Bash script must start with #!/usr/bin/env bash and include a comment explaining its purpose.
All script files must be executable.
Avoid using awk.
Your scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors.
A README.md file is mandatory for each project, providing necessary explanations and instructions.
Remember, plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Ensure you come up with your solutions to meet the learning objectives.

Projects Overview

Create a SSH RSA key pair: Generate an RSA key pair and share the public key for secure access to remote servers.

For Best School loop: Use the for loop to display "Best School" ten times.

While Best School loop: Use the while loop to display "Best School" ten times.

Until Best School loop: Use the until loop to display "Best School" ten times.

If 9, say Hi!: Display "Hi" on the ninth iteration along with "Best School" when using the while loop.

Superstitious numbers: Use the case statement to display various messages based on loop iterations.

Clock: Display time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a while loop.

For ls: Display the content of the current directory in a list format, showing only the part of the name after the first dash.

To file, or not to file: Check and display information about the "school" file, such as existence, emptiness, and regularity.

FizzBuzz: Display numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," 
and both multiples of 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."
